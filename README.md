Reviewing Algoithm Basics while exploring python

Pretty much says it all. I make no promises about the correctness of the algorithms. Actually, I'll make one promise. I prmoise that they are probably not correct. This is a learning process for me as I go through [The Algorithm Design Manual] (http://www.amazon.com/Algorithm-Design-Manual-Steven-Skiena/dp/1848000693 "link to book").

That said, if any one does check out the stuff in here, I welcome feedback/critiques for sucky python code/algorithm design.
